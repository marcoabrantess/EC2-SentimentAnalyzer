I loved the service, everything was perfect!
This is the worst product I’ve ever used.
I'm not sure how I feel about this.
Absolutely fantastic experience.
It was okay, nothing special.
Terrible customer support, I’m disappointed.
The app is very easy to use and intuitive.
It crashed twice, but it works fine now.
Such a great design, I’m impressed!
The delivery was late and nobody answered my emails.
I have no strong opinion about this.
Highly recommend it to everyone!
The documentation is confusing and incomplete.
Well done, I really enjoyed using it.
Not bad, but it could be improved.
